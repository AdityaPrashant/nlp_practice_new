CBC with a white blood cell count of 11.5, hemoglobin of 9.5, and INR of 1.13.,IMPRESSION: , A 67-year-old male with multiple comorbidities with penile discharge and pale-appearing glans.  It seems that the patient has had multiple catheterizations recently and has history of peripheral vascular disease.  I think it is due to chronic ischemic changes.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , Our recommendation would be:,1.  To remove the Foley catheter.,2.  Local hygiene.,3.  Local application of bacitracin ointment.,4.  Antibiotic for urinary tract infection.,5.  Follow up as needed.  Of note, it was explained to the patient that the appearance of this glans may improve or may get worsened but at this point, there is no indication to operate on him.  If increased purulent discharge, the patient was asked to call us sooner, otherwise follow up as scheduled.\n",

Hyperlipidemia.,7.  Parkinson's.,8.  Congestive heart failure.,About 30 minutes were spent during the procedure and the Foley catheter was placed, Foley was irrigated and significant amount of clots were obtained.  Plan is for urine culture, antibiotics.  Plan is for renal ultrasound to rule out any pathology.  The patient will need cystoscopy and evaluation of the prostate.  Apparently, the patient's PSA is 0.45, so the patient is at low to no risk of prostate cancer at this time.  Continued Foley catheter at this point.  We will think about starting the patient on alpha-blockers once the patient's over all medical condition is improved and stable.\n",

      "CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Bladder cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a history of gross hematuria.  The patient presented to the emergency room near his hometown on 12/24/2007 for evaluation of this gross hematuria.  CT scan was performed, which demonstrated no hydronephrosis or upper tract process; however, there was significant thickening of the left and posterior bladder wall.  Urology referral was initiated and the patient was sent to be evaluated by Dr. X. He eventually underwent a bladder biopsy on 01/18/08, which demonstrated high-grade transitional cell carcinoma without any muscularis propria in the specimen.  Additionally, the patient underwent workup for a right adrenal lesion, which was noted on the initial CT scan.  This workup involved serum cortisol analysis as well as potassium and aldosterone and ACTH level measurement.  All of this workup was found to be grossly negative.  Secondary to the absence of muscle in the specimen, the patient was taken back to the operating room on 02/27/08 by Dr. X and the tumor was noted to be very large with significant tumor burden as well as possible involvement of the bladder neck.  At that time, the referring urologist determined the tumor to be too large and risky for local resection, and the patient was referred to ABCD Urology for management and diagnosis.  The patient presents today for evaluation by Dr. Y.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Includes condyloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, undiagnosed COPD, peripheral vascular disease, and claudication.

The patient states he has one uncle who died of lung cancer.  He denies any other family history.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient smokes approximately 2 packs per day times greater than 40 years.  He does drink occasional alcohol approximately 5 to 6 alcoholic drinks per month.  He denies any drug use.  He is a retired liquor store owner.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  He is a well-developed, well-nourished Caucasian male, who appears slightly older than stated age.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature is 96.7, blood pressure is 108/57, pulse is 75, and weight of 193.8 pounds.  HEAD AND NECK:  Normocephalic atraumatic.  LUNGS:  Demonstrate decreased breath sounds globally with small rhonchi in the inferior right lung, which is clear somewhat with cough.  HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  The liver and spleen are not palpably enlarged.  There is a large midline defect covered by skin, of which the fascia has numerous holes poking through.  These small hernias are of approximately 2 cm in diameter at the largest and are nontender.  GU:  The penis is circumcised and there are no lesions, plaques, masses or deformities.  There is some tenderness to palpation near the meatus where 20-French Foley catheter is in place.  Testes are bilaterally descended and there are no masses or tenderness.  There is bilateral mild atrophy.  Epididymidis are grossly within normal limits bilaterally.  Spermatic cords are grossly within normal limits.  There are no palpable inguinal hernias.  RECTAL:  The prostate is mildly enlarged with a small focal firm area in the midline near the apex.  There is however no other focal nodules.  The prostate is grossly approximately 35 to 40 g and is globally firm.  Rectal sphincter tone is grossly within normal limits and there is stool in the rectal vault.  EXTREMITIES:  Demonstrate no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  There is dark red urine in the Foley bag collection.,LABORATORY EXAM:,  Review of laboratory from outside facility demonstrates creatinine of 2.38 with BUN of 42.  Additionally, laboratory exam demonstrates a grossly normal serum cortisol, ACTH, potassium, aldosterone level during lesion workup.  CT scan was reviewed from outside facility, report states there is left kidney atrophy without hydro or stones and there is thickened left bladder wall and posterior margins with a balloon inflated in the prostate at the time of the exam.  There is a 3.1 cm right heterogeneous adrenal nodule and there are no upper tract lesions or stones noted.,IMPRESSION:,  Bladder cancer.,PLAN:  ,The patient will undergo a completion TURBT on 03/20/08 with bilateral retrograde pyelograms at the time of surgery.  Preoperative workup and laboratory as well as paper work were performed in clinic today with Dr. Y. The patient will be scheduled for anesthesia preop.  The patient will have urine culture redrawn from his Foley or penis at the time of preoperative evaluation with anesthesia.  The patient was counseled extensively approximately 45 minutes on the nature of his disease and basic prognostic indicators and need for additional workup and staging.  The patient understands these instructions and also agrees to quit smoking prior to his next visit.  This patient was seen in evaluation with Dr. Y who agrees with the impression and plan.\n"

Pulses grossly intact.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA:,  Initial ECG shows atrial flutter.,IMPRESSION: , Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so.  I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions.  The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.  After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using \"lollipop posterior patch\" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG.,IMPRESSION: , Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22.  We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself.  Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,I had previously discussed the case with Dr. Y who is the patient's general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient's bedside regarding our findings.\n",

      "PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography.,2. Right femoral selective angiogram.,3. Closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an Angio-Seal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: ,The patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease, who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004. She has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort, and has ongoing risks including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. The decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed. She was prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. A 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. Subsequently, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL. At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. As such, an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. As such, the Perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. We then replaced this with a 6-French Angio-Seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. The patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. Mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. There was normal wall motion in the RAO projection.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. The proximal LAD was 100% occluded. The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. The obtuse marginal branch which operates as an OM-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the OM. This is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. The right coronary artery is dominant. The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. The distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. The posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. The proximal PDA has a 40 to 50% stenosis. The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent. There was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease as noted above. There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. Overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004.,CONCLUSION:, 100% proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. The native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease. The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100% occluded. The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,PLAN:, The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. The patient's goal LDL will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking.,After her bedrest is complete, she will be dispositioned to home, after which, she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month. We will also plan to perform a carotid duplex Doppler ultrasound to evaluate her carotid bruits.\n"

      "Disease: Hyperlipidemia found at index: 655 and tagged as DISEASE\n",
      "SUBJECTIVE:  ,This patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.  ,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  General:  With this illness he has had no problems with fever.  HEENT:  Some runny nose, more runny nose than congestion.  Respiratory:  Denies shortness of breath.  Skin:  He has a peeling skin on the bottom of his feet, mostly the right foot that he is talking about today.  At times it is itchy.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 238.4 pounds, blood pressure 128/74, temperature 97.8, pulse 80, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.  Skin exam:  I checked out the bottom of his right foot.  He has peeling skin visible consistent with tinea pedis.  On the anterior aspect of the right third finger there is a small little raised up area that I believe represents a wart.  The size of this wart is approximately 3 mm in diameter.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Upper respiratory tract infection, persistent.,2.  Tinea pedis.,3.  Wart on the finger.,4.  Hyperlipidemia.,5.  Tobacco abuse.,PLAN: , The patient is getting a refill on Allegra-D.  I am giving him a refill on the Nizoral 2% cream that he should use to the foot area twice a day.  I gave him instructions on how to keep the foot clean and dry because I think the reason we are dealing with this persistent problem is the fact that his feet are hot and sweaty a lot because of his work.  His wart has been present for some time now and he would like to get it frozen.  I offered him the liquid nitrogen treatment and he did agree to it.  I used liquid nitrogen after a verbal consent was obtained from the patient to freeze the wart.  He tolerated the procedure very well.  I froze it once and I allowed for a 3 mm freeze zone.  I gave him verbal wound care instructions after the procedure.  Lastly, when he is fasting I am going to send him to the lab with a slip, which I gave him today for a basic metabolic profile, CBC, fasting lipid profile, and a screening PSA test.  Lastly, for the upper respiratory tract infection, I am giving him amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for 10 days.\n",

      "SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 66-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for a five-month recheck on her type II diabetes mellitus, as well as hypertension.  While here she had a couple of other issues as well.  She stated that she has been having some right shoulder pain.  She denies any injury but certain range of motion does cause it to hurt.  No weakness, numbness or tingling.  As far as her diabetes she states that she only checks her blood sugars in the morning and those have all been ranging less than 100.  She has not been checking any two hours after meals.  Her blood pressures when she does check them have been running normal as well but she does not have any record of these present with her.  No other issues or concerns.  Upon review of her chart it did show that she had a benign breast biopsy done back on 06/11/04 and was told to have a repeat mammogram in six months but she has never had that done so she is needing to have this done as well.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS:,  She is on Hyzaar 50/12.5 one-half p.o. daily, coated aspirin daily, lovastatin 40 mg one-half tab p.o. daily, multivitamin daily, metformin 500 mg one tab p.o. b.i.d.; however, she has been skipping her second dose during the day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She is a nonsmoker.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  As noted above.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Temperature:  98.2.

The breasts do have some scars present underneath them bilaterally from prior breast reduction surgery.  There is no axillary adenopathy or tenderness.  Breasts appear to be symmetric.  There was no nipple discharge or retraction.  No breast tissue retraction noted in either the sitting or the supine position.  Upon palpation there were no palpable lumps or bumps and no palpable discharge.,Musculoskeletal:  She did have full range of motion of her shoulders.  She did have tenderness upon palpation over the right bicipital tendon.  There is no swelling, crepitus or discoloration noted.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:  Most recent hemoglobin A1c was 5.6% back in October 2004.  Most recent lipid checks were obtained back in July 2004.  We have not had this checked since that time.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Type II diabetes mellitus.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Right shoulder pain.,4.  Hyperlipidemia.,PLAN:,1.  She is going to go to lab to obtain a hemoglobin A1c, BMP, lipids, CPK, liver enzymes and quantitative microalbumin.,2.  We are going to set her up for a diagnostic bilateral mammogram due to a history of abnormal mammogram in the past which subsequently showed a benign breast cyst.,3.

      "Disease: hyperlipidemia found at index: 21 and tagged as DISEASE\n",
      "SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 56-year-old female who comes in for a dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and weight reduction.  The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today’s weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient’s basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.\n",
      "Disease: hyperlipidemia found at index: 11 and tagged as DISEASE\n",
      "SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome.  The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 275 pounds.  Food records were reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.,PLAN:,  A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.  Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day.  This was a half hour consultation.  We will plan to see the patient back in one month for support.\n",

Hyperlipidemia.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 39-year-old woman returns for followup management of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Her last visit was approximately 4 months ago.  Since that time, the patient states her health had been good and her glycemic control had been good, however, within the past 2 weeks she had a pump malfunction, had to get a new pump and was not certain of her pump settings and has been having some difficulty with glycemic control over the past 2 weeks.  She is not reporting any severe hypoglycemic events, but is having some difficulty with hyperglycemia both fasting and postprandial.  She is not reporting polyuria, polydipsia or polyphagia.  She is not exercising at this point and has a diet that is rather typical of woman with twins and a young single child as well.  She is working on a full-time basis and so eats on the run a lot, probably eats more than she should and not making the best choices, little time for physical activity.  She is keeping up with all her other appointments and has recently had a good eye examination.  She had lab work done at her previous visit and this revealed persistent hyperlipidemic state with a LDL of 144.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.  Zoloft 50 mg p.o. once daily.,2.  Lisinopril 40 mg once daily.,3.  Symlin 60 micrograms, not taking at this point.,4.  Folic acid 2 by mouth every day.,5.  NovoLog insulin via insulin pump about 90 units of insulin per day.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She denies fever, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, dyspnea on exertion or change in exercise tolerance.  She is not having painful urination or blood in the urine.  She is not reporting polyuria, polydipsia or polyphagia.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  Today showed a very pleasant, well-nourished woman, in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature not taken, pulse 98, respirations 20, blood pressure 148/89, and weight 91.19 kg.  THORAX:  Revealed lungs clear, PA and lateral without adventitious sounds.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Demonstrated regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2 without murmur.  No S3, no S4 auscultated.  ABDOMEN:  Nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  SKIN:  Intact and do not appear atrophic.  Deep tendon reflexes were 2+/4 without a delayed relaxation phase.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Dated 10/05/08 showed a total cholesterol of 223, triglyceride 140, HDL 54, and LDL 144.  The hemoglobin A1c was 6.4 and the spot urine for microalbumin was 9.2 micrograms of protein, 1 mg of creatinine.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 102, CO2 30 mEq, BUN 11 mg/dL, creatinine 0.6 mg, estimated GFR greater than 60, blood sugar 118, calcium 9.4, and her LFTs were unremarkable.  TSH is 1.07 and free T4 is 0.81.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,1.  This is a return visit to the endocrine clinic for the patient, a 39-year-old woman with history as noted above.  Plan today is to make adjustments to her pump based on a total daily dose of 90 units of insulin.  Basal rate is as follows, 12 a.m. 1.5, 02:30 a.m. 1.75, and 6 a.m. 1.5.  Her correction factor is 19.  Her carb/insulin ratio is 6.  Her active insulin time is 5 and her targets are at 12 a.m. 110 and 6 a.m. to midnight is 100.  We made adjustments to her pump and the plan will be to see her back in approximately 2 months.,2.  Hyperlipidemia.  The patient is not taking statin, therefore, we will prescribe Lipitor 20 mg one p.o. once daily.  Have her watch for side effects from the medication and plan to do a fasting lipid panel and CMP approximately 8 weeks from now.,3.  We will get a hemoglobin A1c and spot urine for albumin in 8 weeks as well.\n"

      "REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup evaluation and management of chronic medical conditions.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient has been doing quite well since he was last seen.  He comes in today with his daughter.  He has had no symptoms of CAD or CHF.  He had followup with Dr. X and she thought he was doing quite well as well.  He has had no symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.  He has had no falls.  His right knee does pain him at times and he is using occasional doses of Tylenol for that.  He wonders whether he could use a knee brace to help him with that issue as well.  His spirits are good.  He has had no incontinence.  His memory is clear, as is his thinking.,MEDICATIONS:,1.  Bumex - 2 mg daily.,2.  Aspirin - 81 mg daily.,3.  Lisinopril - 40 mg daily.,4.  NPH insulin - 65 units in the morning and 25 units in the evening.,5.  Zocor - 80 mg daily.,6.  Toprol-XL - 200 mg daily.,7.  Protonix - 40 mg daily.,8.  Chondroitin/glucosamine - no longer using.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  Weight 240, blood pressure by nurse 160/80, by me 140/78, pulse 91 and regular, and O2 saturation 94%.  He is afebrile.  JVP is normal without HJR.  CTAP.  RRR.  S1 and S2.  Aortic murmur unchanged.  Abdomen:  Soft, NT without HSM, normal BS.  Extremities:  No edema on today's examination.  Awake, alert, attentive, able to get up on to the examination table under his own power.  Able to get up out of a chair with normal get up and go.  Bilateral OA changes of the knee.,Creatinine 1.7, which was down from 2.3.  A1c 7.6 down from 8.5.  Total cholesterol 192, HDL 37, and triglycerides 487.,ASSESSMENTS:,1.  Congestive heart failure, stable on current regimen.  Continue.,2.  Diabetes type II, A1c improved with increased doses of NPH insulin.  Doing self-blood glucose monitoring with values in the morning between 100 and 130.  Continue current regimen.  Recheck A1c on return.,3.  Hyperlipidemia, at last visit, he had 3+ protein in his urine.  TSH was normal.  We will get a 24-hour urine to rule out nephrosis as the cause of his hypertriglyceridemia.  In the interim, both Dr. X and I have been considering together as to whether the patient should have an agent added to treat his hypertriglyceridemia.  Specifically we were considering TriCor (fenofibrate).  Given his problems with high CPK values in the past for now, we have decided not to engage in that strategy.  We will leave open for the future.  Check fasting lipid panel today.,4.  Chronic renal insufficiency, improved with reduction in dose of Bumex over time.,5.  Arthritis, stable.  I told the patient he could use Extra Strength Tylenol up to 4 grams a day, but I suggest that he start with a regular dose of 1 to 2 to 3 grams per day.  He states he will inch that up slowly.  With regard to a brace, he stated he used one in the past and that did not help very much.  I worry a little bit about the tourniquet type effect of a brace that could increase his edema or put him at risk for venous thromboembolic disease.  For now he will continue with his cane and walker.,6.  Health maintenance, flu vaccination today.,PLANS: , Followup in 3 months, by phone sooner as needed.\n",

      "SUBJECTIVE: , The patient states that she feels better.  She is on IV amiodarone, the dosage pattern is appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.,The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  She states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  Her only allergy is listed to latex.,OBJECTIVE:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  The patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional PAC.,GENERAL:  She is alert and in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Eyes:  EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae nonicteric.  No lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  Funduscopic examination unremarkable.  Ears:  Normal set, shape, TMs, canals and hearing.  Nose and Sinuses:  Negative.  Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, and Throat:  Negative except for dental work.,NECK:  Supple and pain free without bruit, JVD, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.,CHEST:  Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  The incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.,HEART:  Shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  There is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no evidence of DVT, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient's managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.  Wolff-Parkinson White Syndrome.,3.  Recent aortic valve replacement with bioprosthetic Medtronic valve.,4.  Hyperlipidemia.\n"

      "Disease: hyperlipidemia found at index: 988 and tagged as DISEASE\n",
      "REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney.  He was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: , Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: , The patient was brought to the Hospital Emergency Department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  He has no recollection of the event.  The following information is obtained from his medical record.  On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times \"I do not feel well\" and looked \"glazed.\"  He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  She thought he was warm and had chills.  He later returned to his baseline.  He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  The patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  He was hospitalized at Hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative EEG, MRI showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  He was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.,In 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an MRI at that time which showed some small vessel changes.,During this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  He thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  When I asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he \"felt fine the whole time.\"  He appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  So, The patient reported some age related \"memory lapses\" such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  However, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  He denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  He does not have to recheck information for errors.  He is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  He reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  He said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  He reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  He did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  He remains completely independent in his ADLs.  He denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  He is also able to handle their finances.  He did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Includes coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by Dr. Y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.  Note that due to back pain, he had been taking Percocet daily prior to his hospitalization.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, Vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, Coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener.  Note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking Lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , Surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  The patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  He quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  He denied any illicit drug use.  Please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  He also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient's sleep deprived EEG was recommended.,MRI completed on 09/30/09 showed \"mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated June 15, 2007.  No evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  CT scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  EEG was negative.  Deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  Note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:, Reportedly significant for TIAs in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.  In addition, his father had a history of heart disease and passed away at the age of 75.  He has one sister with diabetes and thought his mom might have had diabetes as well.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient obtained a law degree from the University of Baltimore.  He did not complete his undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland because he was able to transfer his credits in order to attend law school at that time.  He reported that he did not obtain very good grades until he reached law school, at which point he graduated in the top 10 of his class and had no problem passing the Bar.  He thought that effort and motivation were important to his success in his school and he had not felt very motivated previously.  He reported that he repeated math classes \"every year of school\" and attended summer school every year due to that.  He has worked as a tax attorney for the past 48 years and reported having a thriving practice with clients all across the country.  He served also in the U.S.  Coast Guard between 1951 and 1953.  He has been married for the past 36 years to his wife, Linda, who is a homemaker.  They have four children and he reported having good relationship with them.  He described being very active.  He goes for dancing four to five times a week, swims daily, plays golf regularly and spends significant amounts of time socializing with friends.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient denied any history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  He reported that some stressors occasionally contribute to mildly low mood at this time, but that these are transient.,TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II), Token Test, Sentence Repetition, Visual Naming, Controlled Oral Word Association, Spelling Test, Aural Comprehension, Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test\n"

      "CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Neck pain, thoracalgia, low back pain, bilateral lower extremity pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Ms. XYZ is a fairly healthy 69-year-old Richman, Roseburg resident who carries a history of chronic migraine, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and mitral valve prolapse.  She has previously been under the care of Dr. Ninan Matthew in the 1990s and takes Maxalt on a weekly basis and nadolol, omeprazole and amitriptyline for treatment of her migraines, which occur about once a week.  She is under the care of Dr. Bonaparte for hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism.  She has a long history of back and neck pain with multiple injuries in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  In 2000, she developed \"sciatica\" mostly in her right lower extremity.,She is seen today with no outside imaging, except with MRI of her cervical spine and lumbar spine dated February of 2004.  Her cervical MRI reveals an 8 mm central spinal canal at C6-7, multilevel foraminal stenosis, though her report is not complete as we do not have all the pages.  Her lumbar MRI reveals lumbar spinal stenosis at L4-5 with multilevel facet arthropathy and spondylitic changes.,The patient has essentially three major pain complaints.,Her first pain complaint is one of a long history of axial neck pain without particular radicular symptoms.  She complains of popping, clicking, grinding and occasional stiffness in her neck, as well as occasional periscapular pain and upper trapezius myofascial pain and spasms with occasional cervicalgic headaches.  She has been told by Dr. Megahed in the past that she is not considered a surgical candidate.  She has done physical therapy twice as recently as three years ago for treatment of her symptoms.  She complains of occasional pain and stiffness in both hands, but no particular numbness or tingling.,Her next painful complaint is one of midthoracic pain and thoracalgia features with some right-sided rib pain in a non-dermatomal distribution.  Her rib pain was not preceded by any type of vesicular rash and is reproducible, though is not made worse with coughing.  There is no associated shortness of breath.  She denies inciting trauma and also complains of pain along the costochondral and sternochondral junctions anteriorly.  She denies associated positive or negative sensory findings, chest pain or palpitations, dyspnea, hemoptysis, cough, or sputum production.  Her weight has been stable without any type of constitutional symptoms.,Her next painful complaint is one of axial low back pain with early morning pain and stiffness, which improves somewhat later in the day.  She complains of occasional subjective weakness to the right lower extremity.  Her pain is worse with sitting, standing and is essentially worse in the supine position.  Five years ago, she developed symptoms radiating in an L5-S1 distribution and within the last couple of years, began to develop numbness in the same distribution.  She has noted some subjective atrophy as well of the right calf.  She denies associated bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, or falls.  She has treated her back symptoms with physical therapy as well.,She is intolerant to any type of antiinflammatory medications as well and has a number of allergies to multiple medications.

The patient walks with a normal gait pattern.  There is no antalgia, spasticity, or ataxia.  She can alternately leg stand without difficulty, as well as tandem walk, stand on the heels and toes without difficulty.  She can flex her lumbar spine and touch the floor with her fingertips.  Lumbar extension and ipsilateral bending provoke her axial back pain.  There is tenderness over the PSIS on the right and no particular pelvic asymmetry.,Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.  Cervical range of motion is slightly limited in extension, but is otherwise intact to flexion and lateral rotation.  The neck is supple.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid is not particularly enlarged.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Heart has regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

Brisk capillary refill is evident over both upper extremities.,Musculoskeletal examination reveals medial joint line tenderness of both knees with some varus laxity of the right lower extremity.  She has chronic osteoarthritic changes evident over both hands.  There is mild restriction of range of motion of the right shoulder, but no active impingement signs.,Inspection of the axial skeleton reveals a cervicothoracic head-forward posture with slight internal rotation of the upper shoulders.  Palpation of the axial skeleton reveals mild midline tenderness at the lower lumbar levels one fingerbreadth lateral to the midline.  There is no midline spinous process tenderness over the cervicothoracic regions.  Palpation of the articular pillars is met with mild provocation of pain.  Palpation of the right posterior, posterolateral and lateral borders of the lower ribs is met with mild provocable tenderness.  There is also tenderness at the sternochondral and costochondral junctions of the right, as well as the left bilaterally.  The xiphoid process is not particularly tender.  There is no dermatomal sensory abnormality in the thoracic spine appreciated.  Mild facetal features are evident over the sacral spine with extension and lateral bending at the level of the sacral ala.,Neurological examination of the upper and lower extremities reveals 3/5 reflexes of the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, and patellar bilaterally.  I cannot elicit S1 reflexes.  There are no long tract signs.  Negative Hoffman's, negative Spurling's, no clonus, and negative Babinski.  Motor examination of the upper, as well as lower extremities appears to be intact throughout.  I may be able to detect a slight hand of atrophy of the right calf muscles, but this is truly unclear and no measurement was made.,SUMMARY OF DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING:,  As per above.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Osteoarthritis.,2.  Cervical spinal stenosis.,3.  Lumbar spinal stenosis.,4.  Lumbar radiculopathy, mostly likely at the right L5-S1 levels.,5.  History of mild spondylolisthesis of the lumbosacral spine at L4-L5 and right sacroiliac joint dysfunction.,6.  Chronic pain syndrome with myofascial pain and spasms of the trapezius and greater complexes.,PLAN:  ,The natural history and course of the disease was discussed in detail with Mr. XYZ.  Greater than 80 minutes were spent facet-to-face at this visit.  I have offered to re-image her cervical and lumbar spine and have included a thoracic MR imaging and rib series, as well as cervicolumbar flexion and extension views to evaluate for mobile segment and/or thoracic fractures.  I do not suspect any sort of intrathoracic comorbidity such as a neoplasm or mass, though this was discussed.  Pending the results of her preliminary studies, this should be ruled out.  I will see her in followup in about two weeks with the results of her scans.\n"
